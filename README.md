# face-recognition-with-and-without-mask
A project to identify faces with and without mask using CNN, you can refer my previous project on facemask detection for more understanding on this one.


<h3>Requirements:</h3>

```
opencv
keras
python
```

<h3>Process:</h3>
I collected total 20 videos of which has 10 videos with mask, 10 videos without mask for 10 different people.<br>
Converted the videos into images, and trained on these images using CNN,<br>
Saved model in fer files, to be used anytime, and predicting new inmages using this model.


<h3>Info:</h3>
The python hupyter notebooks folder has note books which explain the CNN program used.<br>
Programs folder has differnt programs for the processes mentioned above.<br>
fer files,haarcascade, etc files are required for the  project to detect face.
